        <h1>Exercise 1: The Value of UX</h1>
        <h2>What's the Value of User Experience in Web Development and Design?</h2>
        <p>For this exercise, each team member had to do research on how User Experience Design
            will apply to our future jobs, our dream jobs. We came together to find similar skills between the
            jobs we found. Our team was able to reflect on our research and our findings between three
            different jobs. This will be a great future reference for when we are applying to jobs outside of
            college. Through this exercise we will have more of an understanding of what skills we should
            develop so that we can be the most successful in the future. We now have a strengthened
            strategic approach to our career development.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>We each found jobs that we would like to go in that matches with our fields of study.
            After we had our separate skills written down we started grouping similar ones together. A clear
            common skill was communication and being collaborative. Another skill that we grouped was
            adaptability and experience with working with websites. Being able to work on them and update
            them when needed. We also learned that it is important to know many programming languages
            and to have a good amount of experience overall.</p>
