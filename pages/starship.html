        <h2>We wanted to explore what else a Starship can do besides simply delivering food.</h2>

        <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Ever since it first launched at Purdue in 2019, the autonomous delivery robots have improved in their navigation abilities and the ability to be customized.</p>
        <h3>Robot Specs</h3>
            <li>Robot dimensions (without flag) - 697 x 569 x 571 mm</li>
            <li>Total weight - 35 kg</li>
            <li>Cargo box dimensions - 400 × 320 × 340 mm</li>
            <li>Maximum load - 10 kg</li>
            <li>Maximum speed - 6 km/h</li>
            <li>Battery size - 1260 Wh</li>
            <li>Operating time - over 12 hours of driving time</li>
            <li>Sensors - ultrasonic sensors, 12 cameras, radar, GPS, alarm system, reflectors, time-of-flight cameras, stereo cameras</li>
            <li>Object Identification Distance - up to 200 feet away</li>
            <li>Camera FPS - 2,000 frames per second</li>
            <li>It has compartments for separating hot and cold food (insulation component).</li>
            <li>Securing lock during transport, the lid only opens when prompted by the customer’s mobile app or the company providing service.</li>
        <h3>Observations</h3>
            <li>We saw the starships stopping due to people walking in front of it</li>
            <li>Saw the places where they go when they are not in use at the moment - Meredith South, Winifred, Harrison, Corec, Chick-fil-a</li>
            <li>Got to scan QR codes to see information about the starships</li>
            <li>The starship beeps at you if you move it when it is stationary</li>
        <p>             
                
        
        </p>
        <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
        <h3>Starship use for small student business/personal student use</h3>
        <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
            <li>People are constantly trying to sell different items they have made on the Purdue snapchat stories among other platforms, items like crochet top, art print, nails, etc.</li>
            <li>They can have an easier way of doing this through Starships and the Starship app.            
            <li>When they have an item they want to sell, they can go into the Starship app and go to the section their item fits in, or create a new section.</li>        </li>
            <li>They can set the price they are selling it for and upload it. </li>
            <li>When someone from their campus buys the item, the producer will put it in the Starship and the robot will deliver it. </li>
            <li>After the consumer gets their product, they will hopefully talk about their experience to their peers which will restart the process. </li> 
        <p>in progress</p>
