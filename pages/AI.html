            <h1>Project 3: AI</h1>
            <h2>We wanted to improve current AI apps by combining the best aspects of all along with adding our own touch.</h2>
            <br> 
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Our solution incorporates the use of pets and their use at goal milestones in order to encourage users to consistently use the app to improve their health. It also includes a community aspect by connecting users with their friends and the ability to "challenge" them. </p>
            <br> 
            <h2>Initial Design Process</h2>
            <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
                <li>“Cute” style game to motivate users to be healthy (doing something good for self and cute avatar)</li>
                <li>Incorporating milestones</li>
                <li>Monitoring user health and alerting them when something’s wrong (encouraging them to get help)</li>
                <li>Empowering age?</li>
                <li>Possible problem: Lack of motivation, New Years resolution ppl who don’t easily achieve their physical goals, people struggling with keeping track of physical activity</li>
                <li>Helping people with ADHD focus on tasks?</li>
                <li>Target teenagers-20s?</li>
                <li>Help develop habits for later on?</li>
            <h3>Ideas on Physical Design</h3>
                <li>Show avatar on sleep mode screen?</li>
                <li>Prompts it can generate</li>
                <li>Share with friends</li>
                <li>Point system</li>
                <li>Showing avatar moving with you</li>
                <li>Summary report (add points based on workout score) (sent to phone?)</li>
                <li>Widget on phone/watch to be reminded of goals (show avatar’s status)</li>
                <li>Lots of customization</li>
                <li>Multiple characters (per goal)</li>
            <h3>Notes/Improvements on Next Iteration of Design:</h3>
                <li>Encouraging people to set goals (goal-setting strategy)</li>
                <li>Motivating with gaming/social features</li>
                <li>Potential nostalgia feature (playing game mindset, taking those virtual rewards to in person) incorporating features from other games</li>
                <li>Problem: Goal-setting/achieving is lacking motivation, discipline, no attachment to the fitness tracker to keep going with goal</li>
                <li>Character can be leveled up</li>
                <li>Streaks for how many days you use</li>
                <li>Get items</li>
                <li>Can visit friend’s characters and how they’re doing</li>
                <li>Can go fight them</li>
            <br>
            <h2>Interview Data + Sketches</h2>
            <h3>Questions</h3>

                <li>What strategies do you use to accomplish your set goals?</li>
                <li>Do you usually accomplish your goals with these strategies? If not, then what do you think is lacking in the plan of achieving your goal?</li>

            <h3>Observations</h3>
                <li>We saw the starships stopping due to people walking in front of it</li>
                <li>Saw the places where they go when they are not in use at the moment - Meredith South, Winifred, Harrison, Corec, Chick-fil-a</li>
                <li>Got to scan QR codes to see information about the starships</li>
                <li>The starship beeps at you if you move it when it is stationary</li>
            <br>

            <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
            <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
                <li>People are constantly trying to sell different items they have made on the Purdue snapchat stories among other platforms, items like crochet top, art print, nails, etc.</li>
                <li>They can have an easier way of doing this through Starships and the Starship app.            
                <li>When they have an item they want to sell, they can go into the Starship app and go to the section their item fits in, or create a new section.</li>        </li>
                <li>They can set the price they are selling it for and upload it. </li>
                <li>When someone from their campus buys the item, the producer will put it in the Starship and the robot will deliver it. </li>
                <li>After the consumer gets their product, they will hopefully talk about their experience to their peers which will restart the process. </li>
