            <h1>Project 3: AI</h1>
            <h2>We wanted to improve current AI apps by combining the best aspects of all along with adding our own touch.</h2>
            <br> 
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Our solution incorporates the use of pets and their use at goal milestones in order to encourage users to consistently use the app to improve their health. It also includes a community aspect by connecting users with their friends and the ability to "challenge" them. </p>
            <br> 
            <h2>Initial Design Process</h2>
            <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
                <li>“Cute” style game to motivate users to be healthy (doing something good for self and cute avatar)</li>
                <li>Incorporating milestones</li>
                <li>Monitoring user health and alerting them when something’s wrong (encouraging them to get help)</li>
                <li>Empowering age?</li>
                <li>Possible problem: Lack of motivation, New Years resolution ppl who don’t easily achieve their physical goals, people struggling with keeping track of physical activity</li>
                <li>Helping people with ADHD focus on tasks?</li>
                <li>Target teenagers-20s?</li>
                <li>Help develop habits for later on?</li>
            <h3>Ideas on Physical Design</h3>
                <li>Show avatar on sleep mode screen?</li>
                <li>Prompts it can generate</li>
                <li>Share with friends</li>
                <li>Point system</li>
                <li>Showing avatar moving with you</li>
                <li>Summary report (add points based on workout score) (sent to phone?)</li>
                <li>Widget on phone/watch to be reminded of goals (show avatar’s status)</li>
                <li>Lots of customization</li>
                <li>Multiple characters (per goal)</li>
            <h3>Notes/Improvements on Next Iteration of Design:</h3>
                <li>Encouraging people to set goals (goal-setting strategy)</li>
                <li>Motivating with gaming/social features</li>
                <li>Potential nostalgia feature (playing game mindset, taking those virtual rewards to in person) incorporating features from other games</li>
                <li>Problem: Goal-setting/achieving is lacking motivation, discipline, no attachment to the fitness tracker to keep going with goal</li>
                <li>Character can be leveled up</li>
                <li>Streaks for how many days you use</li>
                <li>Get items</li>
                <li>Can visit friend’s characters and how they’re doing</li>
                <li>Can go fight them</li>
            <br>
            <h2>Interview Data + Sketches</h2>
            <h3>Questions</h3>
                <li>Did you originally get your Apple Watch for your health and wellness? (Physical activity and self-care)</li>
                <li>Do you set goals for yourself using your watch? (revolving your health and wellness)</li>
                <li>What strategies do you use to accomplish your set goals?</li>
                <li>Do you usually accomplish your goals with these strategies? If not, then what do you think is lacking in the plan of achieving your goal?</li>
                <li>Is there a motivator(s) in your life that helps you reach your goal? If so, then describe.</li>
            <h3>Interview Takeaways</h3>
                <li>Setting good goals for physical health habits</li>
                <li>Why do people not stick with fitness resolutions?</li>
                <li>Do kind motivating gestures/reminders encourage people to accomplish their goals (overcome the stress), or does it have no positively related impact?</li>
                <li>In what ways do people create habits/how? (What strategies do and don’t work?)</li>
                <li>Target user group?</li>
                <li>How much gamification are we doing for the app?</li>

            <h2>Scenerios</h2>
            <h3>Possible Scenerio 1</h3>
            <p>People wake up in the morning, check their watch for the time, and see their little animal on the screen which will remind them of their daily goals/tasks. Throughout the day they can look down at their watch and see the animal as their reminder - can have different facial expressions based on task completion. After tasks are completed, their little animal friend will be satisfied. This can also be an app passed down through generations, such as an older sibling telling their younger one to download the app when they are old enough to care about working out and doing physical activity.</p>
            <h3>Possible Scenerio 2</h3>
            <p>Mel wakes up to alarms from her watch. As she is wearing her watch, she is able to look at her wrist to see her cutomized avatar expressing that she wake up and drink water as these are the goals she set for herself this day.</p>
